# mapper-pie-chart-nodes
Implementation of Giotto-TDA's Mapper with pie chart nodes. We use Giotto-TDA in Python to generate the graph structure then use d3 in Javascript to produce the graph visualization. This repository uses data on Passiflora leaves from the paper [Morphometric analysis of Passiflora leaves: the relationship between landmarks of the vasculature and elliptical Fourier descriptors of the blade](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/6/1/giw008/2865207?login=true#supplementary-data)

Step 1: Download the jupyter notebook and the procrustes.py file and put them in the same folder.

Step 2: Inside of your directory, create a folder called "passiflora_pie_graph".

Step 3: Inside of this folder, create a folder called "kepler".

Step 4: Download the rest of the files (except for the readme) and put them in the "kepler" folder.

Step 5: Inside the "kepler" folder, make a folder called "node_avg_outline".

Step 6: Run the Jupyter notebook.

Step 7: Type 

    python3 -m http.server 
    
into a terminal window to start a local server.

Step 8: Go to the URL in the terminal output (something like http://0.0.0.0:8000/).

Step 9: Navigate to the folder containing the index.html file.

Step 10: Now that you have successfully ran the Passiflora example, try modifying it for your data!
